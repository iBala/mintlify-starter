The Preventive Maintenance (PM) module in  Zorp CMMS  helps you create and manage scheduled maintenance tasks for your assets. This proactive approach  minimizes downtime, extends equipment lifespan, and optimizes maintenance costs.

## What is a Preventive Maintenance Schedule?

A preventive maintenance schedule defines a recurring set of tasks assigned to an asset at specific intervals. Zorp CMMS allows you to create detailed PM schedules with customizable settings to ensure your maintenance activities are performed consistently.

## How to Create a Preventive Maintenance Schedule

1. Navigate to the "Preventive Maintenance" section.
2. Click "Create New PM Schedule."
3. Fill out the following details:
  - Schedule Name: Give your PM schedule a clear and descriptive name.
  - Description (Optional): Provide additional details about the purpose of the schedule.
  - Checklist: Select a pre-defined checklist associated with the maintenance tasks. This ensures technicians follow the necessary procedures during each PM activity.
  - Location: Specify the location of the asset(s) covered by the PM schedule (if applicable).
  - Asset(s): Select the specific asset(s) to which this PM schedule applies. You can choose a single asset or include multiple assets for bulk scheduling.
  - Frequency: Define how often the PM tasks should be repeated. Options include: * Hourly: Set the interval in hours (e.g., every 8 hours). * Daily: Choose the frequency of repetition within a day (e.g., every other day). * Monthly: Specify the interval in months (e.g., every 3 months). * Yearly: Set the interval in years (e.g., annually).
  - Start Time & End Time (Optional): Define a preferred window for PM task execution within the chosen frequency (e.g., daily at 8:00 AM).
  - Repetition Mode (Optional): For more granular scheduling, utilize Cron expressions. Cron expressions offer extensive control over scheduling patterns beyond basic intervals. You can find resources online to help you create Cron expressions for your specific needs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.
  - Start Date and End Date: Specify the date on which the PM schedule should begin and end.
