## View Assets
Assets can be viewed in 
1. Grid View - A table view highlighting the asset image, uptime and other information. In most scenarios, this is your default view. The Grid view provides a holistic view of all your assets, their uptime performance in the last few days and other key parameters.
2. Map View - The map view shows visually where your assets are located. This is useful when you have assets spread across the geography and you'd like to visually identify and access them. This is also useful in the case of moving assets.
