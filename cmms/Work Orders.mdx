# What is a Work Order?

A work order is a digital document used to track and manage maintenance tasks assigned to technicians. It outlines the specific steps required to complete the task, assigns responsibility, and tracks progress. Zorp CMMS allows you to create, edit, and manage work orders for all your maintenance needs.

## Work Order Page

The work order page provides a centralized view of all details associated with a specific work order. You can access work order history, track progress, update assigned technicians, add notes, and mark the work order as complete.
