In Zorp, a location is an entity that represents a physical place where your company operates. Here are some important concepts about locations.

## Default Assignee

Every location has a default assignee. The default assignee is the person who is responsible for the location. When a new work order is created for a location, the default assignee is automatically assigned to the work order. The default assignee can be changed when creating or editing a location.
For details, see [Create a Location](https://docs.zorp.one/cmms/Locations)

# Locations and Other Zorp Entities

This section explains how Locations connect to other Zorp entities.

## Assets
An asset is a piece of equipment in an organization. Locations are associated with assets. A location can have more than one asset linked to it. For example, if you set up a location for a warehouse, you might associate all the forklifts in the warehouse with that location.

For more information on assets, see [About Assets](https://docs.zorp.one/cmms/assets)

## Work Orders
A work order is a document that details and records progress on a maintenance task. You can create work orders for maintenance at a location. For example, for plumbing repairs needed at a warehouse.

For more information, see [Create a Work order](https://docs.zorp.one/cmms/WorkOrders#how-to-create-a-work-order)
