## What are Checklists?

Checklists are essentially a blueprint  used to ensure technicians follow standardized procedures during maintenance tasks. They outline a specific set of questions or steps that need to be completed, promoting consistency and quality in maintenance work.  ERPLite CMMS integrates a powerful checklist builder to create customized checklists for various needs.
