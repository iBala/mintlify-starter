## Instant Deployment

One of ERPLite's key advantages is **zero deployment** for mobile:

```
Web Dashboard                    Mobile App
     │                               │
     │  Publish Workflow ──────────► │ Instantly Available
     │                               │
     │  Update Table ──────────────► │ Changes Reflect
     │                               │
     │  Modify Screens ────────────► │ Updated Immediately
     │                               │
