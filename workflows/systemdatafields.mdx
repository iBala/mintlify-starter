Datafields that are provided by default by the ERPLite platform. System Data fields are pre-defined fields common for all the task. System Data Fields have data related to **task & loggedInUser**

## Task Data
Task Data contains data fields related to task like:
- Task created date
- Task updated date
- Details of the User to whom the task is assigned
- Details of the Team to which the task is assigned
- Task Scheduled Time
- Task Status

## loggedInUser Data
loggedInUser data contains data fields related to user and team the task is assigned to:
- Role the user belongs to
- Team the user belongs to
- User Name
- User phone number
- Location of the User

These above information are collected from the device of the user executing the task.

## Usage of Data Fields
Data fields can be used for multiple purposes:
1. Bind Data field to a component
2. Use Data field in Conditions
3. Use Data field in Action

### Bind Data field to a component
we can bind a data field to any read only components. Here's how to do it.
- Go to app builder by clicking any screen
- Drag and drop any component on the screen and click the component.
- You will see options to configure component in the right side of the screen
- You can click the data field icon on any fields like label, subtext etc..
- Data field modal will popup where you can select data fields according to your need

### Use Data field in Condition
Conditions are used to stop a certain action or transition based on the user configured checks.

Currently we can configure two conditions in ERPLite:
1. Location Check
2. Expression Check

We can also write conditions based on the system data fields.

Example : Only go to Screen B from Screen A, if the user belongs to a particular Team otherwise go to Screen C.

### Use Data field in Action
In ERPLite we can define actions to execute after a particular transition.

We can configure three actions to perform after a transition:
1. Push Notification
2. API Action
3. update Data Field

We can use the system data fields in any action.

Example: Send Push Notification Message to the user along with task ID.
