## Overview

Transitions are the connectors between workflow nodes. They define how users move from one screen to another and can trigger automations during navigation.

## What is a Transition?

A transition connects two nodes in your workflow. When a user taps the transition button on a screen, they move to the connected screen.

```
┌────────────┐                    ┌────────────┐
│  Screen A  │ ──── NEXT ────────>│  Screen B  │
└────────────┘    (transition)    └────────────┘
```

## Transition Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Button label shown to users (e.g., "NEXT", "Submit", "Complete") |
| **From Node** | Source screen node |
| **To Node** | Destination screen node |
| **Collect Location** | Whether to capture GPS coordinates during transition |
| **Automations** | Actions to execute during the transition |

---

## Creating a Transition

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Source Node">
    In the workflow builder, click on the screen node you want to connect from
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag Connection">
    Right-click and drag from the blue connection point to another node
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release on Target">
    Drop the connection on the target node's blue connection point
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Click on the transition line to configure its properties
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transition Names

The transition name appears as the button label on the mobile app. Choose clear, action-oriented names:

| Good Names | Avoid |
|------------|-------|
| Submit | Next |
| Complete Inspection | Continue |
| Mark as Delivered | OK |
| Take Photo | Proceed |

<Note>
New transitions are named "NEXT" by default. Always rename them to be descriptive.
</Note>

---

## Location Collection

Enable location collection to capture the user's GPS coordinates when they tap the transition button.

**Use cases:**
- Verify delivery location
- Track field worker movements
- Geo-stamp form submissions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Transition">
    Click on the transition in the workflow builder
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Location">
    Toggle **Collect User Location** to ON
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    The location will be captured automatically during navigation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multiple Transitions

A screen can have multiple outgoing transitions, giving users choices:

```
                    ┌─── Approve ───> Approved Screen
                    │
┌────────────┐     │
│  Review    │ ────┼─── Reject ────> Rejected Screen
└────────────┘     │
                    │
                    └─── Hold ──────> On Hold Screen
```

Each transition appears as a separate button on the mobile app.

---

## Transition Automations

Transitions can trigger automations when users navigate. See [Automation Types](/workflows/autotypes) for details on:

- **Screen Transition Automations**: Run validations, call APIs, update data
- Automations execute after the user taps but before the next screen loads

### Transition Structure

```typescript
interface Transition {
  transitionId: string;
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  fromNodeId: string;
  toNodeId: string;
  collectLocation: boolean;
  automations: TransitionAutomation[];
}

interface TransitionAutomation {
  automationId: string;
  validation?: Validation;
  actionBlocks: ActionBlock[];
}
```

### API: Get Workflow Transitions

```bash
GET /api/v1/workflows/:workflowId
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Response includes `transitions` array with all transition configurations.

### UI Components

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| TransitionEditor | `/src/views/workflows/TransitionEditor/` | Transition configuration |
| TransitionLine | `/src/views/workflows/canvas/` | Visual transition connector |
| AutomationPanel | `/src/views/workflows/automations/` | Transition automation config |

### Event Tracking

```typescript
// Transition events
WorkflowEvents.TRANSITION_CREATED
