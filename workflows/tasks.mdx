## Overview

Tasks are the execution units of workflows. While a workflow defines the blueprint (screens, transitions, logic), a task is a single instance of that workflow being executed by a user.

## Workflow vs Task

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Workflow** | The blueprint/template | "Delivery Process" workflow |
| **Task** | A single execution instance | Delivery #1234 to John Doe |

One workflow can have thousands of tasks created from it.

---

## Task Properties

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Workflow** | Which workflow this task is based on |
| **Scheduled From** | Start of the scheduled time window |
| **Scheduled To** | End of the scheduled time window |

<Note>
Scheduled times have default values but are required. They define when the task should be executed.
</Note>

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Assignee** | User or team responsible for the task |
| **Create-time Data** | Data fields marked as "create time" in the workflow |

## Creating Tasks

### Single Task Creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workflow">
    Go to the workflow you want to create a task from
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Task">
    Click the **+ Create Task** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Schedule">
    Enter the scheduled from and to times
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign (Optional)">
    Select an assignee (user or team)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill Create-time Fields">
    Enter values for any create-time data fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create** to create the task
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk Task Creation

Create multiple tasks at once using CSV import:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare CSV">
    Create a CSV with columns for scheduled times, assignee, and create-time fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Import">
    Click **Import Tasks** in the workflow view
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload File">
    Select your CSV file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Columns">
    Map CSV columns to task fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import">
    Click **Import** to create all tasks
  </Step>
</Steps>

### API Task Creation

Create tasks programmatically via the API:

```bash
POST /api/v1/tasks
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "workflowId": "wf_abc123",
  "scheduledSlot": {
    "from": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z",
    "to": "2024-01-15T17:00:00Z"
  },
  "assignedTo": {
    "userId": "user_123"
  },
  "data": {
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "delivery_address": "123 Main St"
  }
}
```

---

## Task Assignment

### Assigning to a User

Select a specific user to execute the task:

```json
{
  "assignedTo": {
    "userId": "user_123"
  }
}
```

### Assigning to a Team

Assign to a team - any member can pick it up:

```json
{
  "assignedTo": {
    "teamId": "team_456"
  }
}
```

### Assignment Notifications

When a task is assigned:
- **Mobile App**: User receives a push notification
- **Web**: Task appears in their task list
- **Email**: Optional email notification (if configured)

---

## Task States

Tasks move through states defined by the workflow:

```
NEW (Initial) → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED (Terminal)
                    ↓
               CANCELLED (Terminal)
```

| State Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Initial** | Starting state (e.g., NEW) |
| **In Progress** | User is working on the task |
| **Terminal** | Final states (e.g., COMPLETED, CANCELLED) |

State transitions happen when users navigate through workflow screens.

---

## Tasks on Web

The web view displays tasks similar to table records:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **List View** | See all tasks with filters and sorting |
| **Task Details** | View task data, current state, history |
| **State Indicator** | Visual indicator of current workflow state |
| **Timeline** | See progression through workflow states |

### Filtering Tasks

Filter tasks by:
- Status/State
- Assignee
- Scheduled date range
- Create-time field values

---

## Tasks on Mobile

On the mobile app, tasks are executed through the workflow screens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive Notification">
    User gets push notification when assigned
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Task">
    Task appears in their task list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Screens">
    Navigate through workflow screens, filling in data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete">
    Reach a terminal state to complete the task
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Mobile Task List

Users see:
- Assigned tasks
- Scheduled time window
- Current state/screen
- Priority indicators

---

## Scheduling

### Scheduled Time Window

Every task has a scheduled time window:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Scheduled From** | When the task can start |
| **Scheduled To** | Deadline for completion |

### Default Values

If not specified, defaults are applied:
- **From**: Current date/time
- **To**: End of current day

### Overdue Tasks

Tasks past their `scheduled_to` time are marked as overdue in both web and mobile views.

## Task Lifecycle

```
┌──────────────┐
│    CREATE    │ Task created (web, bulk, or API)
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│    ASSIGN    │ Optional: assign to user/team
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   EXECUTE    │ User works through workflow screens
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   COMPLETE   │ Task reaches terminal state
└──────────────┘
```

---

## Task Automations

Task-level automations are configured in the workflow. See [Automation Types](/workflows/autotypes) for:

- **Task Event Automations**: Triggered on task create, assign, update, delete
- **Scheduled Slot Changes**: When task schedule is modified
