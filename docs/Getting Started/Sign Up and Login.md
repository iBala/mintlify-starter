# Sign Up
Sign up to ZORP via the [web url](https://app.zorp.one/#/signup). Sign up cannot be done via the ZORP apps.
There are 2 ways of signing up to ZORP. 
- Google Sign In
- Email Sign Up

Google Sign In will reduce the additional email authentication that you would require if you do a direct email sign up.

Post the email verification, enter some basic details that will help us to create the account. The details are
- Full Name
- Phone Number
- Account Name 
- Password

Your account ID is the defining entity for your account. Our customers typically use their company brand name. After you submit the form, you will be routed to your new ZORP account.

# Login
Login in ZORP is even simpler. 
On the [web](https://app.zorp.one/#/login), our users can login by entering the user identifier and password. 

User identifier can be one of
- Email ID
- Phone Number
- UserId (generated when you add a user in ZORP dashboard.)

Login via the ZORP [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=one.zorp) and [iOS App](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/zorp-user/id1581396842) follow the same process.
