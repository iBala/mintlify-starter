Going live with your workflow is as simple as clicking on the publish button on Zorp. Before you publish, make sure you name the workflow in an identifiable manner. 

Once you hit publish on any workflow, a few things happen
- Create an interface on "Task" tab to create a new task for the published workflow. 
- Create an interface on "Task" tab to create tasks in bulk
- Create an API schema for Tasks to be created via API

## Task Creation
Now that the workflow is live, let's go ahead and create a task. There are 3 ways to create a task on Zorp. 
- Single task creation
- Bulk task creation
- via task creation APIs

These options can be accessed from `Task->Create` and choosing the right workflow. 

## Task Assignment
Once the task is created, it can be assigned to the right user by clicking on `CHANGE TEAM/USER` button in the task details page.
