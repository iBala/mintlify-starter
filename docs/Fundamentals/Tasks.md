A task is an instance of a workflow. Think of the workflow as the design for macbook pro. Now, multiple macbook pro devices can be built on the same design. 

Similarly, Workflow becomes the blueprint of the task. A task is typically created against an entity. The entity can be an order (eg., ecommerce) or a subscription or a customer or a lead or an item or anything else. 

A task can be created through the Zorp dashboard or via the Zorp mobile app (if the task creation from mobile app is enabled).

All the task details are present under `Tasks`.
