Workflows are like a blueprint of your process. For example, a workflow is like a model of a house. Multiple houses can be built on the same model. Similarly, multiple tasks can be created based on the same workflow. The workflow has information about the list of steps the user needs to go through to complete the process.

Workflows consist of Steps and Transitions. They are defined below.

## Steps
The steps indicate different possible scenarios a user can be in. 
Eg., Imagine a warehouse worker is moving products from the inventory to their loading bay. Here, the worker could be looking for the product or picked up the product or loading the product into the truck. Each of these steps put together form the workflow. 

## Transitions
Transitions indicate how these steps are connected to one another. 

The instance of a workflow is called a [task](https://docs.zorp.one/Fundamentals/Tasks). Once the workflow is live, users can create tasks from the dashboard which will help them execute their process.
