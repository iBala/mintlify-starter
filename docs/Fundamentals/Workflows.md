Workflows are like a blueprint to your application. 

Each application in Zorp specifies a proess to be done. Each process has multiple steps. The steps indicate different possible scenarios a user can be in. 
Eg., Imagine a warehouse worker is moving products from the inventory to their loading bay. Here, the worker could be looking for the product or picked up the product or loading the product into the truck. Each of these steps put together forms the workflow. 

## Transitions
Transitions indicate how these steps are connected to one another.
