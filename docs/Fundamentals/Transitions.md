A transition is a connector that connects two states. 

Transition offers a couple of major controls.
- Ability to call any [action](https://docs.zorp.one/Fundamentals/Actions) thereby any external API
- Ability to control the execution by offering validations. Validations provide a way for a user to write some control mechanisms on whether a particular state needs to be passed or not.

Few common set of validations are
- Check if the user reached the location they are supposed to reach
- Check if the user picked up all the products that they are supposed to pick
