# Step
A step in simple terms is a part of the entire workflow. In real world terms, each step corresponds to one screen of the mobile application.

For eg., let's consider a scenario where the sales person is collecting data from their client. There are multiple steps in this process like travel, visit, data collection, verification etc. Here, Data collection is a step in the workflow and there is a mobile app screen that corresponds to this step. 

A step has multiple properties, they are defined below. 

### Step Name: 
Each step has a name that it can be identified with.
The name of the step is shown to the user on the ground so they're aware of which step of the process they are in. 

### Step Description: 
Description is provided for clarity on what a step means.

# Components
Components are UI elements that can be used to design the screen of the mobile app. 

There are over 15 UI components in Zorp with which our users can design really powerful applications easily.

UI Elements are higher order ready made components with which development of a screen becomes very easy. 

For eg., for a user to collect images from the app or show a map location, all they have to do is to drag and drop the component into the app screen and change the configurations on the config tab. 

## Component Configuration
Each component has its own way of configuration. For eg., a text display component only takes a text as an input. Whereas the camera component has options to specific collection mode via camera or gallery, no of images that need to be collected and many more. 

## Workign with data
As described [here](https://docs.zorp.one/Getting%20Started/Creating%20Datafields), components can read data from data fields and also can write into data fields.
