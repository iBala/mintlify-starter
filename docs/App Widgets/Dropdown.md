# Dropdown 

The Dropdown component is a Input Component where you can select predefined inputs from the user.
Setting up a dropdown component is similar to setting up a Checkbox component.

## Setting up a Dropdown Component

3. Enter the Title of the component.
4. Enter the options to be shown in the Dropdown component. 
        The Options has two parts : Label and Value 
        *Label* gets shown to the user on the App and *Value* is the value to be used by the system.

    Example:
    If you are creating a Sales lead collection app and want to collect the subscription they are interested in. 
    Option 1: 3 months Value: 3
    Option 2: 6 months Value: 6. 

    Here the user sees both labels on the app screen but the system stores the Values (3,6) into the datafield assigned to the Dropdown component
