The Checkbox component is a Input Component where you can select predefined inputs from the user .

2. Select the Datafield where you want to store the Option(s) selected from the checkbox component.

3. Enter the Title title of the component.
4. Enter the options to be shown in the Checkbox component. 
        The Options has two parts : Label and Value 
        *Label* gets shown to the user on the App and *Value* is the value to be used by the system.

    Example:
    If you are creating a Sales lead collection app and want to collect the subscription they are interested in. 
    Option 1: 3 months Value: 3
    Option 2: 6 months Value: 6. 

    Here the user sees both labels on the app screen but the system stores the Values (3,6) into the datafield assigned to the checkbox component

Checkbox Component ✔️ :)
