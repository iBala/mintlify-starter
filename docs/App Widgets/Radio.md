# Radio 

The Radio component is a Input Component where you can select predefined inputs from the user.
Setting up a Radio component is similar to setting up a Checkbox and dropdown component except the fact that Radio component does not allow Multi-select. You can get the user to select only one option.

## Setting up a Radio Component

1. Drag and Drop the Radio component onto the App Screen builder of the canvas.
2. Select the Datafield where you want to store the Option selected from the Radio component.

3. Enter the Title of the component.
4. Enter the options to be shown in the Radio component. 
        The Options has two parts : Label and Value 
        *Label* gets shown to the user on the App and *Value* is the value to be used by the system.

    Example:
    If you are creating a Sales lead collection app and want to collect the subscription they are interested in. 
    Option 1: 3 months Value: 3
    Option 2: 6 months Value: 6. 

    Here the user sees both labels on the app screen but the system stores the Values (3 or 6) into the datafield assigned to the Radio component


## Where can I use this?

1. Field Sales  
2. Data collection form
3. Quizzes
