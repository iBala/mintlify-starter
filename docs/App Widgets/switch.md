# Switch
A switch component helps you display binary values in your UI, such as Yes/No or True/False. <space> <space>
## What is a Switch?
A switch is used to indicate the presence or absence of an attribute or a value. Once slided towards the right, the switch is on, which implies the presence of that attribute. The absence of the attribute, marked by a gray color, white notch pointing to the left.  <space> <space> 
  
  
   <space> <space>
     
 

> For Example: Suppose the component to be installed is “Is the customer at home?” then the app maker can use the Switch widget. The default value would be “true” or the customer is at his home. If the user switches off the attribute, by sliding the white notch to the left, this indicates that the customer is not at his home.  <space> <space>

## Switch Configurations 
There are four configurations to the Switch app widget, they are namely:  <space> <space>
-  **Label Name** - It indicates the name of your Attribute or Value. In the above example, The Label Name was “Is the customer at his home?”. The default Label Name is “Label”. 
- **Default Value** - The default value of the switch attribute is “True”. It can however be changed according to the maker’s needs. 
- **Is Disabled** - The Is Disabled option allows the maker to restrict the user to change a specified option of the switch. This is useful when we need to show the status of the attribute instead of collecting it from the user.
- **Save Data to Data field** - The input data provided by the user must be stored in a specific data field. The app maker can choose the right data field from this box. If there’s no data field available, the user can create one via the “Create data field” flow.
