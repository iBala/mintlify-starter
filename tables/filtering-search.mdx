## Overview

ERPLite provides powerful filtering and search capabilities to help you find and focus on specific records within your tables.

---

## Global Search

Search across all text-based columns in your table.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Search">
    Click the **Search** icon in the toolbar, or press `Ctrl/Cmd + F`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Search Term">
    Type your search query in the search box
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Results">
    Results update automatically as you type (with a brief delay for performance)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Search Behavior

- Searches across all **text-based columns** (Text, Choice, List of Text)
- **Case-insensitive** matching
- **Partial matches** supported (searching "john" finds "Johnson")
- Results update with a **1-second debounce** for performance

<Tip>
Global search is best for quick lookups. For more precise filtering, use Column Filters.
</Tip>

- Each column can have one active filter

### Clearing Filters

- **Single filter**: Click the X next to the filter
- **All filters**: Click **Clear Filters** in the toolbar
- Filters show a badge count when active

## Sorting

Sort your table by one or more columns.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Column Header">
    Click on any column header to sort by that column
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle Direction">
    Click again to toggle between ascending and descending
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Sort">
    Click a third time or use the column menu to clear sorting
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Multi-Column Sort

Hold **Shift** while clicking column headers to sort by multiple columns. The sort priority follows the order you clicked.

---

## Saving Filter States

To preserve your filters and sorting:

1. Apply your desired filters and sorting
2. Click **Save as View** (see [Views](/tables/views))
3. The view saves all current filter, sort, and column visibility settings

### API: Search Records

```bash
POST /zorp-tables-service/table/search
Authorization: Bearer {secretKey}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tableTypes": ["my_table"],
  "page": 0,
  "size": 50,
  "searchText": "john",
  "filters": [
    {
      "id": "status",
      "type": "equals",
      "value": "Active"
    },
    {
      "id": "created_date",
      "type": "after",
      "value": "2024-01-01"
    }
  ],
  "sorting": [
    {
      "id": "name",
      "desc": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Filter Structure

```typescript
interface ColumnFilter {
  id: string;          // Column name
  type: string;        // Operator (equals, contains, etc.)
  value: string | number | boolean | string[];
}
```

### Sorting Structure

```typescript
interface SortingState {
  id: string;          // Column name
  desc: boolean;       // true for descending, false for ascending
  keyword?: boolean;   // For text fields, sort as keyword
}
```

### Search Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `tableTypes` | string[] | Tables to search in |
| `page` | number | Page number (0-indexed) |
| `size` | number | Records per page |
| `searchText` | string | Global search text |
| `filters` | ColumnFilter[] | Column-specific filters |
| `sorting` | SortingState[] | Sort configuration |
| `recordIds` | string[] | Filter to specific record IDs |

### Response Structure

```json
{
  "code": "200",
  "data": {
    "records": [
      {
        "recordId": "rec_123",
        "data": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "status": "Active"
        },
        "createdOn": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "updatedOn": "2024-01-16T14:20:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "total": 150,
    "page": 0,
    "size": 50
  }
}
```

### Common Filter Patterns

**Filter by date range:**
```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "id": "created_date",
      "type": "between",
      "value": ["2024-01-01", "2024-01-31"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Filter by multiple choice values:**
```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "id": "status",
      "type": "is_any_of",
      "value": ["Active", "Pending"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Combined filters:**
```json
{
  "searchText": "urgent",
  "filters": [
    {
      "id": "priority",
      "type": "equals",
      "value": "High"
    },
    {
      "id": "assigned_to",
      "type": "is_not_empty",
      "value": true
    }
  ],
  "sorting": [
    {
      "id": "due_date",
      "desc": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### UI Elements

| Element | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Search Input | Toolbar | Global text search |
| Filter Button | Toolbar | Toggle filter row |
| Filter Badge | Filter button | Shows active filter count |
| Column Filter | Column header | Per-column filter input |
| Sort Indicator | Column header | Shows sort direction |
| Clear Filters | Toolbar | Remove all active filters |

### State Persistence

Filter and sort states are stored in localStorage:
```
Key: tableState_${tableType}_${viewId}
Value: {
  columnFilters: [...],
  sorting: [...],
  globalFilter: "search text",
  showColumnFilters: true
}
```

### Event Tracking

```typescript
// Filter events
TableRSEvents.FILTER_APPLIED
TableRSEvents.FILTER_REMOVED
TableRSEvents.FILTERS_CLEARED

// Sort events
TableRSEvents.SORT_APPLIED
TableRSEvents.SORT_REMOVED

// Search events
TableRSEvents.GLOBAL_SEARCH_APPLIED
```
